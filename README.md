# Credit-Union-Member-Financial-Planner
This program evaluates a credit union member's current financial holdings in crypto, stock and bonds using API calls for current prices. It then evaluates the member's current portfolio has enough emergency funds (assumed to be three months worth of income). A Monte Carlo simulation is then run to forecast probable (95% confidence ratio based on past performance) financial futures for different stock and bond portfolio proportions on 30 and 10 year scales and give the member a likely range of outcomes for them to gauge their time to retirement possibility and the difference it makes if they increase their portfolio weight to a higher percent of stock holdings.
